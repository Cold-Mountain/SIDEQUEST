## ‚öôÔ∏è Quest Generation System

Quests are built using:
- A database of **quest blocks** ("seeds")  
- User inputs (mode)  
- **Location data** (via IP, user input, or Google Maps API)  
- **External APIs** for real-time data:
  - Atlas Obscura (unique sites)  
  - Google Places / Maps / Explore  
  - OpenWeather API  
  - Spotify API (music tasks)  
  - Airbnb Experiences  
  - Amtrak / Megabus / Greyhound APIs  
  - RSS feeds from local travel blogs  
- **AI Integration** (Claude, Gemini, etc.) to create coherent quest narratives

New in Version 0.1.0: Chunks!

Chunks are specialized subsets of quests powered by dedicated APIs or algorithms tailored to specific outdoor or exploratory themes.

Each Chunk corresponds to a unique type of activity and pulls from its own data sources to generate relevant and exciting quests. These are integrated directly into the quest generation pipeline, offering deeper variety, realism, and regional nuance.

üåç Initial Chunks:
BaseChunk.ts
BeachChunk.ts
ChunkManager.ts
CoolnessCalculator.ts
GoogleBeachChunk.ts
GoogleCatCafeChunk.ts
GoogleHikingAreaChunk.ts
GoogleJapaneseInnChunk.ts
GoogleMarinaChunk.ts
GoogleObservationDeckChunk.ts
GoogleOffRoadingChunk.ts
GooglePsychicChunk.ts
HikingChunk.ts
LighthouseChunk.ts
MountainChunk.ts
NationalParkChunk.ts
ObscuraChunk.ts
PierChunk.ts
SkateboardParkChunk.ts
WindGeneratorChunk.ts

May be condition-dependent, activating only in specific seasons, weather, or regions

(e.g., canoeing quests won‚Äôt appear during winter or in arid regions)

This modular chunk system enables richer customization and more meaningful adventures tailored to both user input and environmental context.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Framework: React / Vue / Next.js  
- Components: Quest cards, timer, nav, point UI  
- State: Quest state, user profile, points, streak  
- Design: Mobile-first, responsive  

### Quest Generation Pipeline
1. Pull matching blocks from DB  
2. Query external APIs (location, weather, events)  
3. Calculate quest time:
   - Travel time (Google Maps API)  
   - Action time (from DB) + 10% buffer  
4. Generate narrative using AI  
5. Cache quest data for offline use

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
